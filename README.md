In the Applied Data Science Lab at the WorldQuant University, out of the eight (8) end-to-end projects, aimed at developing skills for success in data-centric careers, I have completed two (2). These projects focused on the complete data science pipeline, encompassing data wrangling, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and the effective communication of insights.
The Project highlights:
1.	HOUSING IN MEXICO: I worked with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico, to determine whether sale prices are influenced by property size or location. Imported and cleaned data from a CSV file, applied exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics and data visualization, and examined the relationship between the two variables using correlation.
2.	APARTMENT SALES IN BUENOS AIRES: Built a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Created a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library, built a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features, improved model performance by reducing overfitting and created a dynamic dashboard for interacting with the model.
